This is an extension to the CE C toolchain that generates application rather
than program files.

To use, replace the `include` statement for the CE C toolchain in your
project's makefile with path to the `makefile` file in this repository.

8ek files can be generated by running `make app`, however, they are not signed
and therefore cannot be sent to an unmodified calculator.
        
make_segments.py can be used to generate a list of appvars named AppIns*, that can be concatenated to an app located at the end of user archive with the INST program.
