KhiCAS for ti84ce: (c) 2024 B. Parisse et al. License GPL2. Source code

Preliminary version, there are probably bugs remaining, that might
cause crash and reset. If you enter an infinite loop of memory error
while leaving KhiCAS, press and keep reset pressed 3-4 seconds to
clear the RAM. If that does not work, keep 2nd+trace pressed as well
as reset (this will flash the screen and clear the ram. Another
shortcut is reset+2nd+del to be able to flash the calc and send the OS again).
This will require almost all the flash archive (131Ko remaining after install).
Beware: the TI84 CPU is an evolution of a CPU from 1976. It is much slower than a current CPU, e.g. about 10* slower than a Casio fxcg50 processor, or 100* slower than a Numworks. Be prepared to wait if you run a non trivial computation.

Beware: the install program below will write in the calculator user flash. If the install program freezes the calculator, press 2nd and del, then the reset button while 2nd and del are pressed. Then press cancel to erase all the flash, transfer the OS to the calc. If you make another install try, do not use the bundle file khicas84.b84 (step 2 or b below).

======================================================================
Install tested on a 83ce with OS 5.3.0, with 3014Ko archive available
======================================================================
        1/ Backup your data, apps and lang packages, then reset archive memory (2nd mem 7 rightarrow 3), remove lang packages (2nd mem 2 1)
        2/ Transfer transfer INST, artifice and all the files in app, in this order, to the calculator. If you are using TI Connect CE on Windows, you can instead transfer https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~parisse/ti/khicas84.b84. If you are using tilp under linux, run the transfert_tilp.sh script (don't use the GUI)
        3/ Run INST from prgm. 
        4/ IMPORTANT: reset the RAM with 2nd mem 7 1
After install, check and remove the variables AppIns* (installation file not required anymore).
        
===================================================================
For more recent OS (5.5 or above), the process is more complicated
===================================================================
Since TI has disabled asm, we will have to run artifice (https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/) and asmhook (https://github.com/jacobly0/asmhook).
        a/ Backup your data, apps (especially CabriJr) and your language pack. Reset archive memory (2nd mem 7 rightarrow 3), remove language packs. (2nd mem 2 1)
        b/ Transfer transfer INST, artifice and all the files in app, in this order, to the calculator. If you are using TI Connect CE on Windows, you can instead transfer https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~parisse/ti/khicas84.b84.  If you are using tilp under linux, run the transfert_tilp.sh script (don't use the GUI).
        c/ transfer CabriJr. CabriJr is available from TI site or from tiplanet (https://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_voir.php?id=168570)
        d/ open CabriJr from apps
        e/ open artifice in CabriJr
        f/ run INST. This will reset the calc but not clear the RAM
        g/ IMPORTANT: clear the RAM with 2nd mem 7 1

After install, check and remove the variables AppIns* (installation file not required anymore).

===================================================
Now you can run KhiCAS from app (2nd resol on 83ce)
===================================================
Use the 5 keys just under the screen for fast menus (3 menus per key using 2nd/alpha), press the math key for a list of commands by categories.
Leave KhiCAS from shell with the f(x) key (or 2nd quit).

OS interaction:
a/ KhiCAS can import OS Y1-Y9 and Y0 variables.
Type 2nd L1 to 2nd L6 from KhiCAS shell to get Y1 to Y6. 
This enables 2d input from OS (f(x) key, enter Y1-Y9 or Y0 then 2nd app and run KhiCAS).
b/ KhiCAS auto-saves the last evaled expression in Y2. 
Press the f(x) key to leave KhiCAS shell then f(x) key again to display Yk variables.
You can also explicitly store an expression in Y1-Y9 or Y0 by appending =>Yk (shortcut sto key followed by 2nd L1 to 2nd L6).
This enables 2d output and also plotting that were removed from KhiCAS due to flash memory constraints.
c/ KhiCAS can import TI matrices. Press stats, select matrix, type enter. This will import the given matrix and save it with the same lowercase name.
