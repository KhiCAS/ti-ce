Install tested on a 83ce with OS 5.3.0, with 3014Ko archive available
0/ Backup your data, install requires wiping everything
1/ Reset archive memory (2nd mem 7 rightarrow 3)
2) GarbageCollect (2nd catalog)
Or keep 2nd+del pressed while pressing reset button then erase and send OS.
3/ Transfer all files from app folder to the calc
4/ Transfer LoadLib to the calc
5/ Transfer APPINST to the calc (in RAM, not in archive)
6/ Run GarbageCollect from 2nd catalog
7/ Run APPINST from prgm.
For 83 ce Python, you will have to install artifice then asmhook to be able to run APPINST.
8/ IMPORTANT: reset the RAM with 2nd mem 1 
9/ After that, check and remove the variable AppIns00 (installation file not required anymore).

Now you can run KhiCAS from app (2nd resol on 83ce)
Use the 5 keys just under the screen for fast menus (3 menus per key using 2nd/alpha), math for all commands.
Leave KhiCAS from shell with the f(x) key (or 2nd quit).

OS interaction:
a/ KhiCAS can import OS Y1-Y9 and Y0 variables.
Type 2nd L1 to 2nd L6 from KhiCAS shell to get Y1 to Y6. 
This enables 2d input from OS (f(x) key, enter Y1-Y9 or Y0 then 2nd app and run KhiCAS).
b/ KhiCAS auto-saves the last evaled expression in Y2. 
Press the f(x) key to leave KhiCAS shell then f(x) key again to display Yk variables.
You can also explicitly store an expression in Y1-Y9 or Y0 by appending =>Yk (shortcut sto key followed by 2nd L1 to 2nd L6).
This enables 2d output and also plotting that were removed from KhiCAS due to flash memory constraints.
